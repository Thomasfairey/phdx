Meeting Notes - January 2026

Overall the draft shows promise but needs more theoretical grounding.

Chapter 2 (Literature Review):
- Please expand the discussion on Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital
- The section on habitus needs more critical engagement with recent critiques
- Consider adding Foucault's notion of power/knowledge

Chapter 3 (Methodology):
- Justify your choice of semi-structured interviews more clearly
- Add a reflexivity statement about your positionality

General:
- Watch your use of passive voice - try to be more direct
- Some paragraphs are running too long - aim for 150-200 words
```
