Chapter 1: Introduction

This thesis examines the impact of artificial intelligence on academic research methodologies.
The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies has fundamentally transformed how
researchers approach data analysis and interpretation.

The research questions addressed in this study are:

1. How has AI changed the landscape of academic research?
2. What are the ethical implications of using AI in research?
3. How can institutions adapt to integrate AI tools effectively?

This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of publication
trends with qualitative interviews of researchers across multiple disciplines. The findings
suggest that while AI offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and pattern
recognition, there remain important considerations regarding reproducibility and transparency.

The contribution of this thesis lies in its comprehensive framework for evaluating AI
integration in academic settings. This framework addresses both technical capabilities
and ethical considerations, providing practical guidelines for researchers and institutions.
